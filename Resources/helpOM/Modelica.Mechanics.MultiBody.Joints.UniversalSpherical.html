<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component consists of a <strong>universal joint</strong> at
frame_a and a <strong>spherical joint</strong> at frame_b that are
connected together with a <strong>rigid rod</strong>, see default
animation figure (the arrows are not part of the default
animation):</p>
<p><img alt="model Joints.UniversalSpherical" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Joints/UniversalSpherical.png"/></p>
<p>This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and introduces
the constraint that the distance between the origin of frame_a and
the origin of frame_b is constant (= Frames.length(rRod_ia)). The
universal joint is defined in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint
<strong>1</strong> is along parameter vector n1_a which is fixed in
frame_a.</li>
<li>The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint
<strong>2</strong> is perpendicular to axis 1 and to the line
connecting the universal and the spherical joint.</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed
according to the most often occurring case. In a future release,
axis 2 might be explicitly definable via a parameter. However, the
treatment is much more complicated and the number of operations is
considerably higher, if axis 2 is not orthogonal to axis 1 and to
the connecting rod.</p>
<p>Note, there is a <strong>singularity</strong> when axis 1 and
the connecting rod are parallel to other. Therefore, if possible
n1_a should be selected in such a way that it is perpendicular to
rRod_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the distance to the
singularity is as large as possible).</p>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_ia</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> in the connecting <strong>rod</strong> at
the origin of <strong>frame_a</strong>. The placement of frame_ia
on the rod is implicitly defined by the universal joint (frame_a
and frame_ia coincide when the angles of the two revolute joints of
the universal joint are zero) and by parameter vector
<strong>rRod_ia</strong>, the position vector from the origin of
frame_a to the origin of frame_b, resolved in
frame_<strong>ia</strong>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <strong>reference
configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong> of all
components are <strong>parallel</strong> to other (alternatively,
at least frame_a and frame_ia of the UniversalSpherical joint
should be parallel to other when defining an instance of this
component). Since frame_a and frame_ia are parallel to other,
vector <strong>rRod_ia</strong> from frame_a to frame_b resolved in
frame_<strong>ia</strong> can be resolved in
frame_<strong>a</strong> (or the <strong>world frame</strong>, if
all frames are parallel to other).</p>
<p>This joint aggregation can be used in cases where in reality a
rod with spherical joints at end are present. Such a system has an
additional degree of freedom to rotate the rod along its axis. In
practice this rotation is usually of no interest and is
mathematically removed by replacing one of the spherical joints by
a universal joint. Still, in most cases the
Joints.SphericalSpherical joint aggregation can be used instead of
the UniversalSpherical joint since the rod is animated and its mass
properties are approximated by a point mass in the middle of the
rod. The SphericalSpherical joint has the advantage that it does
not have a singular configuration.</p>
<p>In the public interface of the UniversalSpherical joint, the
following (final) <strong>parameters</strong> are provided:</p>
<pre>
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real rodLength(unit="m")  "Length of rod";
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real eRod_ia[3] "Unit vector along rod, resolved in frame_ia";
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real e2_ia  [3] "Unit vector along axis 2, resolved in frame_ia";
</pre>
<p>This allows a more convenient definition of data which is
related to the rod. For example, if a box shall be connected at
frame_ia directing from the origin of frame_a to the middle of the
rod, this might be defined as:</p>
<pre>
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.UniversalSpherical jointUS(rRod_ia={1.2, 1, 0.2});
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Visualizers.FixedShape    shape(shapeType       = "box",
                                              lengthDirection = jointUS.eRod_ia,
                                              widthDirection  = jointUS.e2_ia,
                                              length          = jointUS.rodLength/2,
                                              width           = jointUS.rodLength/10);
  <strong>equation</strong>
    <strong>connect</strong>(jointUS.frame_ia, shape.frame_a);
