<p>This component consists of <strong>3 revolute</strong> joints
with parallel axes of rotation that are connected together by two
rods, see the default animation in the following figure (the axes
vectors are not part of the default animation):</p>

<p>This joint aggregation introduces neither constraints nor state
variables and should therefore be used in kinematic loops whenever
possible to avoid non-linear systems of equations. It is only
meaningful to use this component in <strong>planar loops</strong>.
Basically, the position and orientation of the 3 revolute joints as
well as of frame_ia, frame_ib, and frame_im are calculated by
solving analytically a non-linear equation, given the position and
orientation at frame_a and at frame_b.</p>
<p>Connector <strong>frame_a</strong> is the "left" side of the
first revolute joint whereas <strong>frame_ia</strong> is the
"right side of this revolute joint, fixed in rod 1. Connector
<strong>frame_b</strong> is the "right" side of the third revolute
joint whereas <strong>frame_ib</strong> is the "left" side of this
revolute joint, fixed in rod 2. Finally, connector
<strong>frame_im</strong> is the connector at the "right" side of
the revolute joint in the middle, fixed in rod 2.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <strong>reference
configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong> of all
components are <strong>parallel</strong> to each other
(alternatively, at least frame_a, frame_ia, frame_im, frame_ib,
frame_b of the JointRRR joint should be parallel to each other when
defining an instance of this component).</p>
<p>Basically, the JointRRR model consists internally of a universal
- spherical - revolute joint aggregation (= JointUSR). In a planar
loop this will behave as if 3 revolute joints with parallel axes
are connected by rigid rods.</p>
