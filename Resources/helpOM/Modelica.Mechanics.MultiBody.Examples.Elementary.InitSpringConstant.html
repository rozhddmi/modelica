<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This example demonstrates a non-standard type of initialization
by calculating a spring constant such that a simple pendulum is at
a defined position in steady state.</p>
<p>The goal is that the pendulum should be in steady state when the
rotation angle of the pendulum is zero. The spring constant of the
spring shall be calculated during initialization such that this
goal is reached.</p>
<p>The pendulum has one degree of freedom, i.e., two states.
Therefore, two additional equations have to be provided for
initialization. However, parameter "c" of the spring component is
defined with attribute "fixed = <strong>false</strong>", i.e., the
value of this parameter is computed during initialization.
Therefore, there is one additional equation required during
initialization. The 3 initial equations are the rotational angle of
the revolute joint and its first and second derivative. The latter
ones are zero, in order to initialize in steady state. By setting
the start values of phi, w, a to zero and their fixed attributes to
true, the required 3 initial equations are defined.</p>
<p>After translation, this model is initialized in steady-state.
The spring constant is computed as c = 49.05 N/m. An animation of
this simulation is shown in the figure below.</p>
