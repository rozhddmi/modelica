<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Model <strong>World</strong> represents a global coordinate
system fixed in ground. This model serves several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is used as <strong>inertial system</strong> in which the
equations of all elements of the MultiBody library are
defined.</li>
<li>It is the world frame of an <strong>animation window</strong>
in which all elements of the MultiBody library are visualized.</li>
<li>It is used to define the <strong>gravity field</strong> in
which a multi-body model is present. Default is a uniform gravity
field where the gravity acceleration vector g is the same at every
position. Additionally, a point gravity field or no gravity can be
selected. Also, function gravityAcceleration can be redeclared to a
user-defined function that computes the gravity acceleration, see
example <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Elementary.UserDefinedGravityField.html">
Examples.Elementary.UserDefinedGravityField</a>.</li>
<li>It is used to define <strong>default settings</strong> of
animation properties (e.g., the diameter of a sphere representing
by default the center of mass of a body, or the diameters of the
cylinders representing a revolute joint).</li>
<li>It is used to define a <strong>visual representation</strong>
of the world model (= 3 coordinate axes with labels), of the
defined gravity field and of a ground plane perpendicular to the
gravity direction.<br/>

</ul>
<p>Since the gravity field function is required from all bodies
with mass and the default settings of animation properties are
required from nearly every component, exactly one instance of model
World needs to be present in every model on the top level. The
basic declaration needs to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>inner</strong> Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.World world
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Note, it must be an <strong>inner</strong> declaration with
instance name <strong>world</strong> in order that this world
object can be accessed from all objects in the model. When dragging
the "World" object from the package browser into the diagram layer,
this declaration is automatically generated (this is defined via
annotations in model World).</p>
<p>All vectors and tensors of a mechanical system are resolved in a
frame that is local to the corresponding component. Usually, if all
relative joint coordinates vanish, the local frames of all
components are parallel to each other, as well as to the world
frame (this holds as long as a Parts.FixedRotation, component is
<strong>not</strong> used). In this "reference configuration" it is
therefore alternatively possible to resolve all vectors in the
world frame, since all frames are parallel to each other. This is
often very convenient. In order to give some visual support in such
a situation, in the icon of a World instance two axes of the world
frame are shown and the labels of these axes can be set via
parameters.</p>
