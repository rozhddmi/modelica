<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>6</strong> signals of the <strong>load</strong>
connector are interpreted as the x-, y- and z-coordinates of a
<strong>force</strong> and as the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of a
<strong>torque</strong> acting at the frame connector to which
frame_b of this component is attached. If connector
<strong>frame_resolve</strong> is <strong>not</strong> connected,
the force and torque coordinates are with respect to
<strong>frame_b</strong>. If connector
<strong>frame_resolve</strong> is connected, the force and torque
coordinates are with respect to <strong>frame_resolve</strong>. In
this case the force and torque in connector frame_resolve are set
to zero, i.e., this connector is solely used to provide the
information of the coordinate system, in which the force/torque
coordinates are defined. The input signals are mapped to the force
and torque in the following way:</p>
<pre>
   force  = load[1:3]
   torque = load[4:6]
</pre>
<p>Additionally, a force and torque acts on frame_a in such a way
that the force and torque balance between frame_a and frame_b is
fulfilled.</p>
<p>An example how to use this model is given in the following
figure:</p>
<img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Forces/ForceAndTorque1.png"/>
<p>This leads to the following animation (the yellow cylinder
characterizes the line between frame_a and frame_b of the
ForceAndTorque component, i.e., the force and torque acts with
negative sign also on the opposite side of this cylinder, but for
clarity this is not shown in the animation):</p>
