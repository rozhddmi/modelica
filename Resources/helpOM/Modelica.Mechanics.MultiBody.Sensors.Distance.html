<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>distance</strong> between the origins of frame_a and
of frame_b are determined and provided at the output signal
connector <strong>distance</strong>. This distance is always
positive. <strong>Derivatives</strong> of this signal can be easily
obtained by connecting the block <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.Der.html">Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.Der</a>
to "distance" (this block performs analytic differentiation of the
input signal using the der(..) operator).</p>
<p>In the following figure the animation of a Distance sensor is
shown. The light blue coordinate system is frame_a, the dark blue
coordinate system is frame_b, and the yellow arrow is the animated
sensor.</p>

<p>If the distance is smaller as parameter <strong>s_small</strong>
(in the "advanced" menu), it is approximated such that its
derivative is finite for zero distance. Without such an
approximation, the derivative would be infinite and a division by
zero would occur. The approximation is performed in the following
way: If distance &gt; s_small, it is computed as sqrt(r*r) where r
is the position vector from the origin of frame_a to the origin of
frame_b. If the distance becomes smaller as s_small, the "sqrt()"
function is approximated by a second order polynomial, such that
the function value and its first derivative are identical for
sqrt() and the polynomial at s_small. Furthermore, the polynomial
passes through zero. The effect is, that the distance function is
continuous and differentiable everywhere. The derivative at zero
distance is 3/(2*s_small).</p>
