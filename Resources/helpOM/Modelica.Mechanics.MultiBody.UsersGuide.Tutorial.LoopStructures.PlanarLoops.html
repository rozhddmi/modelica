<p>In the figure below, the model of a V6 engine is shown that has
a simple combustion model. It is available as <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Loops.EngineV6.html">MultiBody.Examples.Loops.EngineV6</a>.</p>

<p>The Modelica schematic of one cylinder is given in the figure
below. Connecting 6 instances of this cylinder appropriately
together results in the engine schematic displayed above.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/LoopStructures/EngineV6_2.png"/></p>
<p>In the next figure the animation of the engine is shown. Every
cylinder consists essentially of 1 prismatic and 2 revolute joints
that form a planar loop, since the axes of the two revolute joints
are parallel to each other and the axis of the prismatic joint is
orthogonal to the revolute joint axes. All 6 cylinders together
form a coupled set of 6 loops that have together 1 degree of
freedom.</p>

<p>All planar loops, and especially the engine, result in a DAE (=
Differential-Algebraic Equation system) that does not have a unique
solution. The reason is that, e.g., the cut forces in direction of
the axes of the revolute joints cannot be uniquely computed. Any
value fulfills the DAE equations. This is a structural property
that is determined by the symbolic algorithms. Since they detect
that the DAE is structurally singular, a further processing is not
possible. Without additional information it is also impossible that
the symbolic algorithms could be enhanced because if the axes of
rotations of the revolute joints are only slightly changed such
that they are no longer parallel to each other, the planar loop can
no longer move and has 0 degrees of freedom. Algorithms based on
pure structural information cannot distinguish these two cases.</p>
<p>The usual remedy is to remove superfluous constraints, e.g.,
along the axis of rotation of <strong>one</strong> revolute joint.
Since this is not easy for an inexperienced modeler, the special
joint: <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.RevolutePlanarLoopConstraint.html">
RevolutePlanarLoopConstraint</a> is provided that removes these
constraints. Exactly one revolute joint in a every planar loop must
be replaced by this joint type. In the engine example, this special
joint is used for the revolute joint B2 in the cylinder model
above. The icon of the joint is slightly different to other
revolute joints to visualize this case.</p>
<p>If a modeler is not aware of the problems with planar loops and
models them without special consideration, a Modelica translator
displays an error message and points out that a planar loop may be
the reason and suggests to use the RevolutePlanarLoopConstraint
joint. This error message is due to an annotation in the Frame
connector.</p>
<pre>
  <strong>connector</strong> Frame
     ...
     <strong>flow</strong> SI.Force f[3] <strong>annotation</strong>(unassignedMessage="..");
  <strong>end</strong> Frame;
</pre>
<p>If no assignment can be found for some forces in a connector,
the "unassignedMessage" is displayed. In most cases the reason for
this is a planar loop or two joints that constrain the same motion.
Both cases are discussed in the error message.</p>
<p>Note, that the non-linear algebraic equations occurring in
planar loops can be solved analytically in most cases and therefore
it is highly recommended to use the techniques discussed in section
"<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.UsersGuide.Tutorial.LoopStructures.AnalyticLoopHandling.html">Analytic
loop handling</a>" for such systems.</p>
