<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component is used to exert a <strong>line force</strong>
between the origin of frame_a and the origin of frame_b by
attaching components of the <strong>1-dimensional
translational</strong> mechanical library of Modelica
(Modelica.Mechanics.Translational) between the two flange
connectors <strong>flange_a</strong> and <strong>flange_b</strong>.
Optionally, there are <strong>two point masses</strong> on the line
connecting the origin of frame_a and the origin of frame_b. These
point masses approximate the <strong>masses</strong> of the
<strong>force element</strong>. The locations of the two point
masses are defined by their (fixed) distances of L_a relative to
frame_a and of L_b relative to frame_b, respectively.</p>
<p>In example <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Elementary.LineForceWithTwoMasses.html">
MultiBody.Examples.Elementary.LineForceWithTwoMasses</a> the usage
of this line force element is shown and is compared with an
alternative implementation using a <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointUPS.html">
MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointUPS</a> component. The composition
diagram of this example is displayed in the figure below.</p>

<p>The animation view at time = 0 is shown in the next figure. The
system on the left side in the front is the animation with the
LineForceWithTwoMasses component whereas the system on the right
side in the back is the animation with the JointUPS component. Both
implementations yield the same result. However, the implementation
with the LineForceWithTwoMasses component is simpler.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Examples/Elementary/LineForceWithTwoMasses2.png"/></p>
<p>In the translational library there is the implicit assumption
that forces of components that have only one flange connector act
with opposite sign on the bearings of the component. This
assumption is also used in the LineForceWithTwoMasses component: If
a connection is present to only one of the flange connectors, then
the force in this flange connector acts implicitly with opposite
sign also in the other flange connector.</p>
