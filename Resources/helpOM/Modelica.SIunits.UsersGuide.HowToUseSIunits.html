<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>When implementing a Modelica model, every variable needs to be
declared. Physical variables should be declared with a unit. The
basic approach in Modelica is that the unit attribute of a variable
is the <strong>unit</strong> in which the
<strong>equations</strong> are <strong>written</strong>, for
example:</p>
<pre>   <strong>model</strong> MassOnGround
     <strong>parameter</strong> Real m(quantity="Mass", unit="kg") "Mass";
     <strong>parameter</strong> Real f(quantity="Force", unit="N") "Driving force";
     Real s(unit="m") "Position of mass";
     Real v(unit="m/s") "Velocity of mass";
   <strong>equation</strong>
     <strong>der</strong>(s) = v;
     m*<strong>der</strong>(v) = f;
   <strong>end</strong> MassOnGround;
</pre>
<p>This means that the equations in the equation section are only
correct for the specified units. A different issue is the user
interface, i.e., in which unit the variable is presented to the
user in graphical user interfaces, both for input (e.g., parameter
menu), as well as for output (e.g., in the plot window).
Preferably, the Modelica tool should provide a list of units from
which the user can select, e.g., "m", "cm", "km", "inch" for
quantity "Length". When storing the value in the model as a
Modelica modifier, it has to be converted to the unit defined in
the declaration. Additionally, the unit used in the graphical user
interface has to be stored. In order to have a standardized way of
doing this, Modelica provides the following three attributes for a
variable of type Real:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>quantity</strong> to define the physical quantity
(e.g., "Length", or "Energy").</li>
<li><strong>unit</strong> to define the unit that has to be used in
order that the equations are correct (e.g., "N.m").</li>
<li><strong>displayUnit</strong> to define the unit used in the
graphical user interface as default display unit for input and/or
output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, a unit, such as "N.m", is not sufficient to define
uniquely the physical quantity, since, e.g., "N.m" might be either
"torque" or "energy". The "quantity" attribute might therefore be
used by a tool to select the corresponding menu from which the user
can select a unit for the corresponding variable.</p>
<p>For example, after providing a value for "m" and "f" in a
parameter menu of an instance of MassOnGround, a tool might
generate the following code:</p>
<pre>
   MassOnGround myObject(m(displayUnit="g")=2, f=3);
</pre>
<p>The meaning is that in the equations a value of "2" is used and
that in the graphical user interface a value of "2000" should be
used, together with the unit "g" from the unit set "Mass" (= the
quantity name). Note, according to the Modelica specification a
tool might ignore the "displayUnit" attribute.</p>
<p>In order to help the Modelica model developer, the
Modelica.SIunits library provides about 450 predefined type names,
together with values for the attributes <strong>quantity</strong>,
<strong>unit</strong> and sometimes <strong>displayUnit</strong>
and <strong>min</strong>. The unit is always selected as SI-unit
according to the ISO standard. The type and the quantity names are
the quantity names used in the ISO standard. "quantity" and "unit"
are defined as "<strong>final</strong>" in order that they cannot
be modified. Attributes "displayUnit" and "min" can, however, be
changed in a model via a modification. The example above, might
therefore be alternatively also defined as:</p>
<pre>   <strong>model</strong> MassOnGround
     <strong>parameter</strong> Modelica.SIunits.Mass  m "Mass";
     <strong>parameter</strong> Modelica.SIunits.Force f "Driving force";
     ...
   <strong>end</strong> MassOnGround;
</pre>
<p>or in a short hand notation as</p>
<pre>
   <strong>model</strong> MassOnGround
     <strong>import</strong> SI = Modelica.SIunits;
     <strong>parameter</strong> SI.Mass  m "Mass";
     <strong>parameter</strong> SI.Force f "Driving force";
     ...
   <strong>end</strong> MassOnGround;
</pre>
<p>For some often used Non SI-units (like hour), some additional
type definitions are present as
Modelica.SIunits.Conversions.NonSIunits. If this is not sufficient,
the user has to define its own types or use the attributes directly
in the declaration as in the example at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Complex units</strong> are also included in
Modelica.SIunits. A complex unit is declared as:</p>
<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> QuasiStationaryMachine
    <strong>parameter</strong> Modelica.SIunits.ComplexPower SNominal = Complex(10000,4400)
       "Nominal complex power";
   ...
   <strong>end</strong> QuasiStationaryMachine;
</pre>
