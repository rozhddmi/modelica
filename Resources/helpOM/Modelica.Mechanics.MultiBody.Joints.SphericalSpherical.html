<p>Joint that has a spherical joint on each of its two ends. The
rod connecting the two spherical joints is approximated by a point
mass that is located in the middle of the rod. When the mass is set
to zero (default), special code for a massless body is generated.
In the following default animation figure, the two spherical joints
are represented by two red spheres, the connecting rod by a grey
cylinder and the point mass in the middle of the rod by a light
blue sphere:</p>

<p>This joint introduces <strong>one constraint</strong> defining
that the distance between the origin of frame_a and the origin of
frame_b is constant (= rodLength). It is highly recommended to use
this joint in loops whenever possible, because this enhances the
efficiency considerably due to smaller systems of non-linear
algebraic equations.</p>
<p>It is sometimes desirable to <strong>compute</strong> the
<strong>rodLength</strong> of the connecting rod during
initialization. For this, parameter <strong>computeLength</strong>
has to be set to <strong>true</strong> and instead
<strong>one</strong> other, easier to determine, position variable
in the same loop needs to have a fixed attribute of
<strong>true</strong>. For example, if a loop consists of one
Revolute joint, one Prismatic joint and a SphericalSpherical joint,
one may fix the start values of the revolute joint angle and of the
relative distance of the prismatic joint in order to compute the
rodLength of the rod.</p>
<p>It is not possible to connect other components, such as a body
with mass properties or a special visual shape object to the rod
connecting the two spherical joints. If this is needed, use instead
joint Joints.<strong>UniversalSpherical</strong> that has this
property.</p>
