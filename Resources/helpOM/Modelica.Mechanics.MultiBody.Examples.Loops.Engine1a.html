<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a model of the mechanical part of one cylinder of an
engine. The combustion is not modelled. The "inertia" component at
the lower left part is the output inertia of the engine driving the
gearbox. The angular velocity of the output inertia has a start
value of 10 rad/s in order to demonstrate the movement of the
engine.</p>
<p>The engine is modeled solely by revolute and prismatic joints.
Since this results in a <strong>planar</strong> loop there is the
well known difficulty that the cut-forces perpendicular to the loop
cannot be uniquely computed, as well as the cut-torques within the
plane. This ambiguity is resolved by using the option
<strong>planarCutJoint</strong> in the <strong>Advanced</strong>
menu of one revolute joint in every planar loop (here: joint B1).
This option sets the cut-force in direction of the axis of
rotation, as well as the cut-torques perpendicular to the axis of
rotation at this joint to zero and makes the problem mathematically
well-formed.</p>
<p>An animation of this example is shown in the figure below.</p>
