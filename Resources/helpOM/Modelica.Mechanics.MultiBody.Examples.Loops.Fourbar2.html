<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a second version of the "four-bar" mechanism, see
figure:</p>
<img alt="model Examples.Loops.Fourbar2" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Examples/Loops/Fourbar2.png"/>
<p>In this case the three revolute joints on the left top-side and
the two revolute joints on the right top side have been replaced by
the joint <strong>UniversalSpherical</strong> that is a rod
connecting a spherical and a universal joint. This joint is defined
by <strong>1 constraint</strong> stating that the distance between
the two spherical joints is constant. Using this joint in a
kinematic loop reduces the sizes of non-linear algebraic equations.
For this loop, only one non-linear algebraic system of equations of
order 1 remains.</p>
<p>At the UniversalSpherical joint an additional frame_ia fixed to
the rod is present where components can be attached to the
connecting rod. In this example just a coordinate system is
attached to visualize frame_ia (coordinate system on the right in
blue color).</p>
<p>Another feature is that the length of the connecting rod can be
automatically calculated during <strong>initialization</strong>. In
order to do this, another initialization condition has to be given.
In this example, the initial value of the distance of the prismatic
joint j2 has been fixed (via the "Initialization" menu) and the rod
length of joint "UniversalSpherical" is computed during
initialization since parameter <strong>computeLength</strong> =
<strong>true</strong> is set in the joint parameter menu. The main
advantage is that during initialization no non-linear system of
equation is solved and therefore initialization always works. To be
precise, the following trivial non-linear equation is actually
solved for rodLength:</p>
<pre>
   rodLength*rodLength = f(angle of revolute joint, distance of prismatic joint)
