<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The M_OLine is a multi line model which consists of several
segments and several single lines. Each segment consists of
resistors and inductors that are connected in series in each single
line, and of capacitors and conductors both between the lines and
to the ground. The inductors are coupled to each other like in the
M_Transformer model. The following picture shows the schematic of a
segment with four single lines (lines=4):</p>
<blockquote><img alt="segment.png" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/segment.png"/></blockquote>
<p>The complete multi line consists of N segments and an auxiliary
segment_last:</p>
<p align="center"><code>-- segment_1 -- segment_2 -- ... --
segment_N -- segment_last --</code></p>
<p>In the picture of the segment can be seen, that a single segment
is asymmetric. Connecting such asymmetric segments in a series
forces also an asymmetric multi line. To get a symmetric model
which is useful for coupling and which guaranties the same pin
properties, in the segment_1 only half valued resistors and
inductors are used. The remaining resistors and inductors are at
the other end of the line within the auxiliary segment_last. For
the example with 4 lines the schematic of segment_last is like
this:</p>
<blockquote><img alt="segment_last.png" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/segment_last.png"/></blockquote>
<p>The number of the capacitors and conductors depends on the
number of single lines that are used, because each line is
connected to every other line by both a capacitor and a conductor.
One line consists of <strong>at least two segments</strong>. Inside
the model M_OLine the model <em>segment</em> is used. This model
represents one segment which is build as described above. For
modelling the inductances and their mutual couplings the model
M_Transformer is used. To fill the resistance vector, resistance
values as many as lines are needed, e.g., if there are four lines,
four resistances are needed. For example for a microelectronic line
of 0.1m length, a sensible resistance-vector would be R=[4.76e5,
1.72e5, 1.72e5, 1.72e5].</p>
<p>Filling the matrices of the inductances, capacitances and
conductances is a bit more complicated, because those components
occur also between two lines and not only (like the resistor) in
one line. The entries of the matrices are given by the user in form
of a vector. The vector length dim_vector_lgc is calculated by
<strong>dim_vector_lgc = lines*(lines+1)/2</strong>. Inside the
model a symmetric inductance matrix, a symmetric capacitance matrix
and a symmetric conductance matrix are built out of the entries of
the vectors given by the user. The way of building is the same for
each matrix, so the approach for filling one of the matrices will
be shown at an example:</p>
<p>The number of lines is assumed to be four. To build the matrix,
the model needs the values from the main diagonal and from the
positions that are below the main diagonal. To get the following
matrix</p>
<blockquote><img alt="Matrix" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/Lines/M_OLine-eqMatrix.png"/></blockquote>
<p>the vector with dim_vector_lgc=4*5/2=10 has to appear in the
following way: vector = [<strong>1</strong>, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4,
<strong>2</strong>, 0.3 0.5, <strong>3</strong>, 0.6,
<strong>4</strong>]</p>
<p>For the example of a microelectronic line of 0.1m length, which
is used as default example for the M_OLine model, a sensible
inductance-matrix would be</p>
<blockquote><img alt="L" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/Lines/M_OLine-eqL.png"/></blockquote>
<p>For the example of a microelectronic line of 0.1m length, which
is used as default example for the M_OLine model, a sensible
capacitance-matrix would be:</p>
<blockquote><img alt="C" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/Lines/M_OLine-eqC.png"/></blockquote>
<p>For the example of a microelectronic line of 0.1m length, which
is used as default example for the M_OLine model, a sensible
conductance-matrix would be:</p>
<blockquote><img alt="G" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/Lines/M_OLine-eqG.png"/></blockquote>
<p>The user has the possibility to enable a conditional heatport.
If so, the M_OLine can be connected to a thermal network. When the
parameter alpha is set to an value greater than zero, the M_OLine
becomes temperature sensitive due to their resistors which
resistances are calculated by R_actual = R*(1 + alpha*(heatPort.T -
T_ref)) and conductors calculated by (G_actual = G/(1 +
alpha*(T_heatPort - T_ref)).</p>
