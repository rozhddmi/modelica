<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>A summary of the common properties of the noise blocks is
provided in the documentation of package <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Noise.html">Blocks.Noise</a>. This
BandLimitedWhiteNoise block generates reproducible, random noise at
its output according to a band-limited white noise distribution.
This is performed by using a normal distribution with mu=0 and
sigma = sqrt(noisePower/samplePeriod).</p>
<p>In order for this block to produce meaningful results, you
should set the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>samplePeriod</strong> of the block should be much
faster (say by a factor of 100) than the fastest dynamics of the
system fed by the block's outputs.</li>
<li>The <strong>noisePower</strong> of the signal should be set to
the expected power per frequency of the white noise. Since many
system models assume a noise power of 1, this preset may be a
reasonable first choice (= default).</li>
</ul>
<h4>About sampling frequencies</h4>
<p>Ideal white noise contains all frequencies, including infinitely
high ones. However, these usually cannot be observed in physical
systems, since all physical systems in one way or the other contain
low-pass filters. It is thus sufficient to generate a limited range
of frequency content in the noise signal, as long as it exceeds the
frequencies of the subsequent dynamics by a sufficiently high
factor (of e.g. 100).</p>
<h4>About noise power</h4>
<p>Ideal white noise has a flat, i.e. constant, power spectral
density for all frequencies. It has thus infinitely high power,
because the total power of a signal can be obtained by integrating
the power spectral density over all frequencies. The following
three ways to think of the power of a signal may be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>The energy of a signal is the integral of its squared absolute
value over time. The signal's power is this integral divided by the
time span of the integral.</li>
<li>The total power of a signal can also be obtained by integrating
its (two-sided) power spectral density over all frequencies.</li>
<li>The total power of a signal is finally also equal to its
variance.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to set the correct level of the band-limited white
noise power spectral density, the variance of its normal
distribution can thus be influenced directly. Recalling that the
samplePeriod of the noise signal generates frequency content in the
range ±0.5/samplePeriod, the variance must be increased to generate
sufficient total signal power. The total power must match the
product of the noisePower and its frequency bandwidth
1/samplePeriod: <code>signal power = signal variance = noisePower /
samplePeriod</code>.</p>

NoiseExamples.DrydenContinuousTurbulence</a> demonstrates how to
utilize this block to model wind gust.</p>
