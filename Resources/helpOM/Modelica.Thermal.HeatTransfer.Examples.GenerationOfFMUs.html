<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This example demonstrates how to generate an input/output block
(e.g. in form of an FMU - <a href="https://www.fmi-standard.org">Functional Mock-up Unit</a>) from
various HeatTransfer components. The goal is to export such an
input/output block from Modelica and import it in another modeling
environment. The essential issue is that before exporting it must
be known in which way the component is utilized in the target
environment. Depending on the target usage, different flange
variables need to be in the interface with either input or output
causality. Note, this example model can be used to test the FMU
export/import of a Modelica tool. Just export the components marked
in the icons as "toFMU" as FMUs and import them back. The models
should then still work and give the same results as a pure Modelica
model.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting two masses</strong><br/>
The upper part (DirectCapacity, InverseCapacity) demonstrates how
to export two heat capacitors and connect them together in a target
system. This requires that one of the capacitors (here:
DirectCapacity) is defined to have states and the temperature and
derivative of temperature are provided in the interface. The other
capacitor (here: InverseCapacity) requires heat flow according to
the provided input temperature and derivative of temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting a conduction element that needs only
temperature</strong><br/>
The lower part (Conductor) demonstrates how to export a conduction
element that needs only temperatures for its conduction law and
connect this conduction law in a target system between two
capacitors.</p>
