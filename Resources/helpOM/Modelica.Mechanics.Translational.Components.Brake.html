<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component models a <strong>brake</strong>, i.e., a
component where a frictional force is acting between the housing
and a flange and a controlled normal force presses the flange to
the housing in order to increase friction. The normal force fn has
to be provided as input signal f_normalized in a normalized form (0
≤ f_normalized ≤ 1), fn = fn_max*f_normalized, where fn_max has to
be provided as parameter. Friction in the brake is modelled in the
following way:</p>
<p>When the absolute velocity "v" is not zero, the friction force
is a function of the velocity dependent friction coefficient mue(v)
, of the normal force "fn", and of a geometry constant "cgeo" which
takes into account the geometry of the device and the assumptions
on the friction distributions:</p>
<pre>
        frictional_force = <strong>cgeo</strong> * <strong>mue</strong>(v) * <strong>fn</strong>
</pre>
<p>Typical values of coefficients of friction:</p>
<pre>
      dry operation   :  <strong>mue</strong> = 0.2 .. 0.4
      operating in oil:  <strong>mue</strong> = 0.05 .. 0.1
</pre>
<p>The positive part of the friction characteristic
<strong>mue</strong>(v), v &gt;= 0, is defined via table mue_pos
(first column = v, second column = mue). Currently, only linear
interpolation in the table is supported.</p>
<p>When the absolute velocity becomes zero, the elements connected
by the friction element become stuck, i.e., the absolute position
remains constant. In this phase the friction force is calculated
from a force balance due to the requirement, that the absolute
acceleration shall be zero. The elements begin to slide when the
friction force exceeds a threshold value, called the maximum static
friction force, computed via:</p>
<pre>
       frictional_force = <strong>peak</strong> * <strong>cgeo</strong> * <strong>mue</strong>(w=0) * <strong>fn</strong>   (<strong>peak</strong> &gt;= 1)
</pre>
<p>This procedure is implemented in a "clean" way by state events
and leads to continuous/discrete systems of equations if friction
elements are dynamically coupled. The method is described in:</p>

Data Flow Principle</strong>. CACSD'99, Aug. 22.-26, Hawaii.</dd>
</dl>
<p>More precise friction models take into account the elasticity of
the material when the two elements are "stuck", as well as other
effects, like hysteresis. This has the advantage that the friction
element can be completely described by a differential equation
without events. The drawback is that the system becomes stiff
(about 10-20 times slower simulation) and that more material
constants have to be supplied which requires more sophisticated
identification. For more details, see the following references,
