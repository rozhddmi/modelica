<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This example demonstrates how to generate an input/output block
(e.g. in form of an FMU - <a href="https://www.fmi-standard.org">Functional Mock-up Unit</a>) from
various Electrical components. The goal is to export such an
input/output block from Modelica and import it in another modeling
environment. The essential issue is that before exporting it must
be known in which way the component is utilized in the target
environment. Depending on the target usage, different connector
variables need to be in the interface with either input or output
causality. Note, this example model can be used to test the FMU
export/import of a Modelica tool. Just export the components marked
in the icons as "toFMU" as FMUs and import them back. The models
should then still work and give the same results as a pure Modelica
model.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting two capacitors</strong><br/>
The first part (DirectCapacitor, InverseCapacitor) demonstrates how
to export two capacitors and connect them together in a target
system. This requires that one of the capacitors (here:
DirectCapacitor) is defined to have states and the voltage and
derivative of voltage are provided in the interface. The other
capacitor (here: InverseCapacitor) requires current according to
the provided input voltage and derivative of voltage.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting a resistance element between two
capacitors</strong><br/>
The second part (Resistor2) demonstrates how to export a resistance
element that needs only voltages for its resistance law and connect
this resistance law in a target system between two capacitors.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting two inductors</strong><br/>
The third part (DirectInductor, InverseInductor) demonstrates how
to export two inductors and connect them together in a target
system. This requires that one of the inductors (here:
DirectInductor) is defined to have states and the current and
derivative of current are provided in the interface. The other
inductor (here: InverseInductor) requires voltage according to the
provided input current and derivative of current.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting a conductance element between two
inductors</strong><br/>
The fourth part (Conductor4) demonstrates how to export a
conductance element that needs only currents for its conductance
law and connect this conductance law in a target system between two
inductors.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that separating physical components and connecting
them via adaptor signals requires to place appropriate <a href="Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Basic.Ground.html">ground
components</a> to define electric potential within the
subcircuits.</p>
