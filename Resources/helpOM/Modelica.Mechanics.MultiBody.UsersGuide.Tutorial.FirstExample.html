<p>As a first example it shall be demonstrated how to build up,
simulate and animate a <strong>simple pendulum</strong>.</p>
<p>A simple pendulum consisting of a <strong>body</strong> and a
<strong>revolute</strong> joint with <strong>linear
damping</strong> in the joint, is first build-up as Modelica
composition diagram, resulting in:</p>
<p><img alt="Modelica composition diagram of simple pendulum" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/FirstExample/PenulumSchematic1.png"/></p>
<p>In the following figure the location of the used model
components is shown. Drag these components in the diagram layer and
connect them according to the figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/FirstExample/PenulumSchematic2.png"/></p>
<p>Every model that uses model components from the MultiBody
library must have an instance of the
Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.World model on highest level. The
reason is that in the world object the gravity field is defined
(uniform gravity or point gravity), as well as the default sizes of
animation shapes and this information is reported to all used
components. If the World object is missing, a warning message is
printed and an instance of the World object with default settings
is automatically utilized (this feature is defined with
annotations).</p>
<p>In a second step the parameters of the dragged components need
to be defined. Some parameters are vectors that have to be defined
with respect to a local coordinate system of the corresponding
component. The easiest way to perform this is to define a
<strong>reference configuration</strong> of your multi-body model:
In this configuration, the relative coordinates of all joints are
zero. This means that all coordinate systems on all components are
parallel to each other. Therefore, this just means that all vectors
are resolved in the world frame in this configuration.</p>
<p>The reference configuration for the simple pendulum shall be
defined in the following way: The y-axis of the world frame is
directed upwards, i.e., the opposite direction of the gravity
acceleration. The x-axis of the world frame is orthogonal to it.
The revolute joint is placed in the origin of the world frame. The
rotation axis of the revolute joint is directed along the z-axis of
the world frame. The body is placed on the x-axis of the world
frame (i.e., the rotation angle of the revolute joint is zero, when
the body is on the x-axis). In the following figures the definition
of this reference configuration is shown in the parameter menus of
the revolute joint and the body:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/FirstExample/ActuatedRevolute.png"/><br/>
<img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/FirstExample/Body.png"/>
</p>
<p>Translate and simulate the model. Automatically, all defined
components are visualized in an animation using default absolute or
relative sizes of the components. For example, a body is visualized
as a sphere and as a cylinder. The default size of the sphere is
defined as parameter in the world object. You may change this size
in the "Animation" parameter menu of the body (see parameter menu
above). The default size of the cylinder is defined relatively to
the size of the sphere (half of the sphere size). With default
settings, the following animation is defined:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Examples/Elementary/Pendulum.png"/></p>
<p>The world coordinate system is visualized as coordinate system
with axes labels. The direction of the gravity acceleration vector
is shown as green arrow. The red cylinder represents the rotation
axis of the revolute joint and the light blue shapes represent the
body. The center of mass of the body is in the middle of the light
blue sphere.</p>
