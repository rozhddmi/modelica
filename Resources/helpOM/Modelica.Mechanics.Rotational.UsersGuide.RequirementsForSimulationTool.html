<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This library is designed in a fully object oriented way in order
that components can be connected together in every meaningful
combination (e.g., direct connection of two springs or two
inertias). As a consequence, most models lead to a system of
differential-algebraic equations of <strong>index 3</strong> (=
constraint equations have to be differentiated twice in order to
arrive at a state space representation) and the Modelica translator
or the simulator has to cope with this system representation.
According to our present knowledge, this requires that the Modelica
translator is able to symbolically differentiate equations
(otherwise it is e.g., not possible to provide consistent initial
conditions; even if consistent initial conditions are present, most
numerical DAE integrators can cope at most with index 2 DAEs).</p>
<p>The elements of this library can be connected together in an
arbitrary way. However, difficulties may occur, if the elements
which can <strong>lock</strong> the <strong>relative
motion</strong> between two flanges are connected
<strong>rigidly</strong> together such that essentially the
<strong>same relative motion</strong> can be locked. The reason is
that the cut-torque in the locked phase is not uniquely defined if
the elements are locked at the same time instant (i.e., there does
not exist a unique solution) and some simulation systems may not be
able to handle this situation, since this leads to a singularity
during simulation. Currently, this type of problem can occur with
the Coulomb friction elements <strong>BearingFriction, Clutch,
Brake, LossyGear</strong> when the elements become stuck:</p>

<p>In the figure above two typical situations are shown: In the
upper part of the figure, the series connection of rigidly attached
BearingFriction and Clutch components are shown. This does not
hurt, because the BearingFriction element can lock the relative
motion between the element and the housing, whereas the clutch
element can lock the relative motion between the two connected
flanges. Contrary, the drive train in the lower part of the figure
may give rise to simulation problems, because the BearingFriction
element and the Brake element can lock the relative motion between
a flange and the housing and these flanges are rigidly connected
together, i.e., essentially the same relative motion can be locked.
These difficulties may be solved by either introducing a compliance
between these flanges or by combining the BearingFriction and Brake
element into one component and resolving the ambiguity of the
frictional torque in the stuck mode. A tool may handle this
situation also <strong>automatically</strong>, by picking one
solution of the infinitely many, e.g., the one where the difference
to the value of the previous time instant is as small as
possible.</p>
