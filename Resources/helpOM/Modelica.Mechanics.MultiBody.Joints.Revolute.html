<p>Joint where frame_b rotates around axis n which is fixed in
frame_a. The two frames coincide when the rotation angle "phi =
0".</p>
<p>Optionally, two additional 1-dimensional mechanical flanges
(flange "axis" represents the driving flange and flange "support"
represents the bearing) can be enabled via parameter
<strong>useAxisFlange</strong>. The enabled axis flange can be
driven with elements of the <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.html">Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational</a>
library.</p>
<p>In the "Advanced" menu it can be defined via parameter
<strong>stateSelect</strong> that the rotation angle "phi" and its
derivative shall be definitely used as states by setting
stateSelect=StateSelect.always. Default is StateSelect.prefer to
use the joint angle and its derivative as preferred states. The
states are usually selected automatically. In certain situations,
especially when closed kinematic loops are present, it might be
slightly more efficient, when using the StateSelect.always
setting.</p>
<p>If a <strong>planar loop</strong> is present, e.g., consisting
of 4 revolute joints where the joint axes are all parallel to each
other, then there is no longer a unique mathematical solution and
the symbolic algorithms will fail. Usually, an error message will
be printed pointing out this situation. In this case, one revolute
joint of the loop has to be replaced by a
Joints.RevolutePlanarLoopConstraint joint. The effect is that from
the 5 constraints of a usual revolute joint, 3 constraints are
removed and replaced by appropriate known variables (e.g., the
force in the direction of the axis of rotation is treated as known
with value equal to zero; for standard revolute joints, this force
is an unknown quantity).</p>
<p>In the following figure the animation of a revolute joint is
shown. The light blue coordinate system is frame_a and the dark
blue coordinate system is frame_b of the joint. The black arrow is
parameter vector "n" defining the translation axis (here: n =
{0,0,1}, phi.start = 45<sup>o</sup>).</p>
