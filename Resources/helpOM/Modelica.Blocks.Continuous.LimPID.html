<p>Via parameter <strong>controllerType</strong> either
<strong>P</strong>, <strong>PI</strong>, <strong>PD</strong>, or
<strong>PID</strong> can be selected. If, e.g., PI is selected, all
components belonging to the D-part are removed from the block (via
conditional declarations). The example model <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Examples.PID_Controller.html">Modelica.Blocks.Examples.PID_Controller</a>
demonstrates the usage of this controller. Several practical
aspects of PID controller design are incorporated according to
chapter 3 of the book:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Åström K.J., and Hägglund T.:</dt>
<dd><strong>PID Controllers: Theory, Design, and Tuning</strong>.
Instrument Society of America, 2nd edition, 1995.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Besides the additive <strong>proportional, integral</strong> and
<strong>derivative</strong> part of this controller, the following
features are present:</p>
<ul>
<li>The output of this controller is limited. If the controller is
in its limits, anti-windup compensation is activated to drive the
integrator state to zero.</li>
<li>The high-frequency gain of the derivative part is limited to
avoid excessive amplification of measurement noise.</li>
<li>Setpoint weighting is present, which allows to weight the
setpoint in the proportional and the derivative part independently
from the measurement. The controller will respond to load
disturbances and measurement noise independently of this setting
(parameters wp, wd). However, setpoint changes will depend on this
setting. For example, it is useful to set the setpoint weight wd
for the derivative part to zero, if steps may occur in the setpoint
signal.</li>
<li>Optional feed-forward. It is possible to add a feed-forward
signal. The feed-forward signal is added before limitation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The parameters of the controller can be manually adjusted by
performing simulations of the closed loop system (= controller +
plant connected together) and using the following strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set very large limits, e.g., yMax = Modelica.Constants.inf</li>
<li>Select a <strong>P</strong>-controller and manually enlarge
parameter <strong>k</strong> (the total gain of the controller)
until the closed-loop response cannot be improved any more.</li>
<li>Select a <strong>PI</strong>-controller and manually adjust
parameters <strong>k</strong> and <strong>Ti</strong> (the time
constant of the integrator). The first value of Ti can be selected,
such that it is in the order of the time constant of the
oscillations occurring with the P-controller. If, e.g., vibrations
in the order of T=10 ms occur in the previous step, start with
Ti=0.01 s.</li>
<li>If you want to make the reaction of the control loop faster
(but probably less robust against disturbances and measurement
noise) select a <strong>PID</strong>-Controller and manually adjust
parameters <strong>k</strong>, <strong>Ti</strong>,
<strong>Td</strong> (time constant of derivative block).</li>
<li>Set the limits yMax and yMin according to your
specification.</li>
<li>Perform simulations such that the output of the PID controller
goes in its limits. Tune <strong>Ni</strong> (Ni*Ti is the time
constant of the anti-windup compensation) such that the input to
the limiter block (= limiter.u) goes quickly enough back to its
limits. If Ni is decreased, this happens faster. If Ni=infinity,
the anti-windup compensation is switched off and the controller
works bad.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Initialization</strong></p>
<p>This block can be initialized in different ways controlled by
parameter <strong>initType</strong>. The possible values of
initType are defined in <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Types.InitPID.html">Modelica.Blocks.Types.InitPID</a>.
This type is identical to <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Types.Init.html">Types.Init</a>, with the
only exception that the additional option
<strong>DoNotUse_InitialIntegratorState</strong> is added for
backward compatibility reasons (= integrator is initialized with
InitialState whereas differential part is initialized with NoInit
which was the initialization in version 2.2 of the Modelica
standard library).</p>
<p>Based on the setting of initType, the integrator (I) and
derivative (D) blocks inside the PID controller are initialized
according to the following table:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td><strong>initType</strong></td>
<td><strong>I.initType</strong></td>
<td><strong>D.initType</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>NoInit</strong></td>
<td>NoInit</td>
<td>NoInit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>SteadyState</strong></td>
<td>SteadyState</td>
<td>SteadyState</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>InitialState</strong></td>
<td>InitialState</td>
<td>InitialState</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>InitialOutput</strong><br/>
and initial equation: y = y_start</td>
<td>NoInit</td>
<td>SteadyState</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DoNotUse_InitialIntegratorState</strong></td>
<td>InitialState</td>
<td>NoInit</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In many cases, the most useful initial condition is
<strong>SteadyState</strong> because initial transients are then no
longer present. If initType = InitPID.SteadyState, then in some
cases difficulties might occur. The reason is the equation of the
integrator:</p>
<pre>
   <strong>der</strong>(y) = k*u;
</pre>
<p>The steady state equation "der(x)=0" leads to the condition that
the input u to the integrator is zero. If the input u is already
(directly or indirectly) defined by another initial condition, then
the initialization problem is <strong>singular</strong> (has none
or infinitely many solutions). This situation occurs often for
mechanical systems, where, e.g., u = desiredSpeed - measuredSpeed
and since speed is both a state and a derivative, it is natural to
initialize it with zero. As sketched this is, however, not
possible. The solution is to not initialize u_m or the variable
that is used to compute u_m by an algebraic equation.</p>
<p>When initializing in steady-state, homotopy-based initialization
can help the convergence of the solver, by using a simplified model
a the beginning of the solution process. Different options are
available.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>homotopyType=Linear</strong> (default): the limitations
are removed from the simplified model, making it linear. Use this
if you know that the controller will not be saturated at steady
state.</li>
<li><strong>homotopyType=UpperLimit</strong>: if it is known a
priori the controller will be stuck at the upper limit yMax, this
option assumes y = yMax as a simplified model.</li>
<li><strong>homotopyType=LowerLimit</strong>: if it is known a
priori the controller will be stuck at the lower limit yMin, this
option assumes y = yMin as a simplified model.</li>
<li><strong>homotopyType=NoHomotopy</strong>: this option does not
apply any simplification and keeps the limiter active throughout
the homotopy transformation. Use this if it is unknown whether the
controller is saturated or not at initialization and if the
limitations on the output must be enforced throughout the entire
homotopy transformation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The parameter <strong>limitAtInit</strong> is obsolete since MSL
3.2.2 and only kept for backwards compatibility.</p>
