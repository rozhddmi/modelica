<p>Please refer to the <strong>Parameters</strong> section for a
schematic drawing of this axis-symmetric lifting magnet. In the
half-section below, the flux tube elements of the actuator's
magnetic circuit are superimposed on a field plot obtained with
FEA. The magnetomotive force imposed by the coil is modelled as one
lumped element. As a result, the radial leakage flux between
armature and yoke that occurs especially at large working air gaps
can not be considered properly. This leads to a a higher total
reluctance and lower inductance respectively compared to FEA for
large working air gaps (i.e., armature close to x_max). Please have
a look at the comments associated with the individual model
components for a short explanation of their purpose in the
model.</p>

<p>The coupling coefficient c_coupl in the coil is set to 1 in this
example, since leakage flux is accounted for explicitly with the
flux tube element G_mLeakWork. Although this leakage model is
rather simple, it describes the reluctance force due to the leakage
field sufficiently, especially at large air gaps. With decreasing
air gap length, the influence of the leakage flux on the actuator's
net reluctance force decreases due to the increasing influence of
the main working air gap G_mAirWork.</p>
<p>During model-based actuator design, the radii and lengths of the
flux tube elements (and hence their cross-sectional areas and flux
densities) should be assigned with parametric equations so that
common design rules are met (e.g., allowed flux density in
ferromagnetic parts, allowed current density and required
cross-sectional area of winding). For simplicity, those equations
are omitted in the example. Instead, the found values are assigned
to the model elements directly.</p>
