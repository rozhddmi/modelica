<h4>Overview of Spice3 library</h4>
<p>The Spice3 library is a Modelica library that contains some
models of the Berkeley SPICE3 analog simulator.</p>
<p><u>General information about the analog simulator SPICE3</u></p>
<p>SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is a
simulator for analog electrical circuits. It was developed as one
of the first analog simulators in the university of Berkeley. SPICE
netlists, which contain the circuit that shall be simulated, are a
de-facto-standard up to now. For nearly every electrical circuit a
SPICE netlist exists. Today the current version of SPICE is
SPICE3e/SPICE3f. SPICE contains basic elements (resistor, inductor,
capacitor), sources and semiconductor devices (diode, bipolar
transistors, junction field effect transistors, MOS-field effect
transistors) as well as models of lines. Out of this offered pool
of elements, the circuits that shall be simulated are build as
SPICE netlists.</p>
<p><u>The Spice3-library for Modelica</u></p>
<p>The Spice3 library was extracted from original SPICE3 C++ code.
To be sure the Modelica models are correct the simulation results
were compared to SPICE3. This way was chosen since SPICE3 is the
only open source Spice simulator.</p>
<p>The Spice3-library was built in accordance to the model
structure in SPICE. It contains the following packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Basic (R, C, L, controlled sources)</li>
<li>Semiconductors (MOS (P, N), BJT(NPN PNP), Diode, semiconductor
resistor)</li>
<li>Sources (constant, sinusoidal, exponential, pulse, piece wise
linear, single-frequency FM, respectively for V and I)</li>
<li>Additionals (useful features from SPICE2)</li>
<li>Interfaces</li>
<li>Internal (functions and data needed to model the semiconductor
devices)<br/></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the semiconductor models, especially MOS and BJT, are very
complex models, many functions, data and parameters were needed for
their description. Therefore a special Package called Internal was
created that contains all the functions and records with data and
parameters that are needed for the semiconductor models. It is not
necessary that a user of the library works inside this package, so
it is not for user access. The package Additionals is also a
special one. It is not part of the original SPICE3. Nevertheless it
contains useful models or features like the polynomial sources of
SPICE2 that are often asked for.</p>
<p>There are many commercial SPICE simulators (PSPICE, NgSPICE,
HSPICE, ...) which are derived from the Berkeley SPICE or are in
some relation to it. Netlists of such SPICE derivatives can differ
from Berkeley SPICE3 netlists. This has to be taken into account if
netlists (their parameter names) are used with this package.</p>
