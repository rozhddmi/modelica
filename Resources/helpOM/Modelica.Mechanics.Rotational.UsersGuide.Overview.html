<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This package contains components to model <strong>1-dimensional
rotational mechanical</strong> systems, including different types
of gearboxes, shafts with inertia, external torques, spring/damper
elements, frictional elements, backlash, elements to measure angle,
angular velocity, angular acceleration and the cut-torque of a
flange. In sublibrary <strong>Examples</strong> several examples
are present to demonstrate the usage of the elements. Just open the
corresponding example model and simulate the model according to the
provided description.</p>
<p>A unique feature of this library is the
<strong>component-oriented</strong> modeling of <strong>Coulomb
friction</strong> elements, such as friction in bearings, clutches,
brakes, and gear efficiency. Even (dynamically) coupled friction
elements, e.g., as in automatic gearboxes, can be handled
<strong>without</strong> introducing stiffness which leads to fast
simulations. The underlying theory is new and is based on the
solution of mixed continuous/discrete systems of equations, i.e.,
equations where the <strong>unknowns</strong> are of type
<strong>Real</strong>, <strong>Integer</strong> or
<strong>Boolean</strong>. Provided appropriate numerical algorithms
for the solution of such types of systems are available in the
simulation tool, the simulation of (dynamically) coupled friction
elements of this library is <strong>efficient</strong> and
<strong>reliable</strong>.</p>

<p>A simple example of the usage of this library is given in the
figure above. This drive consists of a shaft with inertia J1=0.2
which is connected via an ideal gearbox with gear ratio=5 to a
second shaft with inertia J2=5. The left shaft is driven via an
external, sinusoidal torque. The <strong>filled</strong> and
<strong>non-filled grey squares</strong> at the left and right side
of a component represent <strong>mechanical flanges</strong>.
Drawing a line between such squares means that the corresponding
flanges are <strong>rigidly attached</strong> to each other. By
convention in this library, the connector characterized as a
<strong>filled</strong> grey square is called
<strong>flange_a</strong> and placed at the left side of the
component in the "design view" and the connector characterized as a
<strong>non-filled</strong> grey square is called
<strong>flange_b</strong> and placed at the right side of the
component in the "design view". The two connectors are completely
<strong>identical</strong>, with the only exception that the
graphical layout is a little bit different in order to distinguish
them for easier access of the connector variables. For example,
<code>J1.flange_a.tau</code> is the cut-torque in the connector
<code>flange_a</code> of component <code>J1</code>.</p>
<p>The components of this library can be <strong>connected</strong>
together in an <strong>arbitrary</strong> way. E.g., it is possible
to connect two springs or two shafts with inertia directly
together, see figure below.</p>
