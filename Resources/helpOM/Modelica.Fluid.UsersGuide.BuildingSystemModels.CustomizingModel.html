<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Once a system model has been built, it is possible to obtain
different approximations by appropriately setting the defaults in
the System component (and/or the settings of specific
components.</p>
<p>The Assumptions | allowFlowReversal parameter determines whether
reversing flow conditions (i.e., flow direction opposite to design
direction) are modelled or not. By default, reversing flow
conditions are considered by the models, but this causes a
significant increase of complexity in the equations, due to the
conditional equations depending on the flow direction. If you know
in advance that the flow in a certain component (or in the whole
system) will always be in the design direction, then setting this
parameter to false will produce a much faster and possibly more
robust simulation code.</p>
<p>The flags in the Assumptions | Dynamics tab allow different
degrees of approximation on the mass, energy, and momentum
equations of the components.</p>
<ul>
<li>DynamicFreeInitial: dynamic equations are considered (nonzero
storage), no initial equations are provided, and the start values
are used as guess values.</li>
<li>FixedInitial: dynamic equations are considered (nonzero
storage) and initial equations are included, fixing the states to
the start values provided by the component parameters.</li>
<li>SteadyStateInitial: dynamic equations are considered (nonzero
storage), initial equations are included, declaring that the state
derivatives are zero (steady-state initialization) and the start
values are used as guess values for the nonlinear solver.</li>
<li>SteadyState: algebraic (or static) balance equations are
considered (no storage) and the start values are used as guess
values for the nonlinear solver.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is then possible to neglect the storage of mass, momentum,
and energy in the whole system (or just in parts of it) just by a
few mouse clicks in a GUI, and also to change the type of
initialization when considering dynamic models. Please note that
some combinations of the options might be contradictory, and will
therefore trigger compilation errors.</p>
