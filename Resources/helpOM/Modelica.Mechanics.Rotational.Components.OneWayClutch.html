<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component models a <strong>one-way clutch</strong>, i.e., a
component with two flanges where friction is present between the
two flanges and these flanges are pressed together via a normal
force. These flanges may be sliding with respect to each other.</p>
<p>A one-way-clutch is an element where a clutch is connected
in parallel to a free wheel. This special element is provided,
because such a parallel connection introduces an ambiguity into the
model (the constraint torques are not uniquely defined when both
elements are stuck) and this element resolves it by introducing
<strong>one</strong> constraint torque only instead of two
constraints.</p>
<p>Note, initial values have to be chosen for the model such that
the relative speed of the one-way-clutch ≥ 0. Otherwise, the
configuration is physically not possible and an error occurs.</p>
<p>The normal force fn has to be provided as input signal
f_normalized in a normalized form
(0 ≤ f_normalized ≤ 1),
fn = fn_max * f_normalized, where fn_max has to
be provided as parameter.</p>
<p>The friction in the clutch is modeled in the following way. When
the relative angular velocity is positive, the friction torque is a
function of the velocity dependent friction coefficient mue(w_rel),
of the normal force fn, and of a geometry constant cgeo which
takes into account the geometry of the device and the assumptions
on the friction distributions:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
frictional_torque = <strong>cgeo</strong> * <strong>mue</strong>(w_rel) * <strong>fn</strong>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Typical values of coefficients of friction:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
dry operation   :  <strong>mue</strong> = 0.2 .. 0.4
operating in oil:  <strong>mue</strong> = 0.05 .. 0.1
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The geometry constant is calculated - under the assumption of a
uniform rate of wear at the friction surfaces - in the following
way:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>cgeo</strong> = <strong>N</strong>*(<strong>r0</strong> + <strong>ri</strong>)/2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>where <strong>ri</strong> is the inner radius,
<strong>ro</strong> is the outer radius and <strong>N</strong>
is the number of friction interfaces,</p>
<p>The positive part of the friction characteristic
<strong>mue</strong>(w_rel), w_rel &gt;= 0, is defined
via table mue_pos (first column = w_rel, second column = mue).
Currently, only linear interpolation in the table is supported.</p>
<p>When the relative angular velocity w_rel becomes zero, the
elements connected by the friction element become stuck, i.e., the
relative angle remains constant. In this phase the friction torque
is calculated from a torque balance due to the requirement that the
relative acceleration shall be zero. The elements begin to slide
when the friction torque exceeds a threshold value, called the
maximum static friction torque, computed via:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
frictional_torque = <strong>peak</strong> * <strong>cgeo</strong> * <strong>mue</strong>(w_rel=0) * <strong>fn</strong>,   (<strong>peak</strong> &gt;= 1)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This procedure is implemented in a "clean" way by state events
and leads to continuous/discrete systems of equations if friction
elements are dynamically coupled. The method is described in (see
also a short sketch in <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.UsersGuide.ModelingOfFriction.html">
