<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component consists of a <strong>universal</strong> joint at
frame_a, a <strong>revolute</strong> joint at frame_b and a
<strong>spherical</strong> joint which is connected via
<strong>rod1</strong> to the universal and via
<strong>rod2</strong> to the revolute joint, see the default
animation in the following figure (the axes vectors are not part of
the default animation):</p>
<p><img alt="model Joints.Assemblies.JointUSR" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Joints/JointUSR.png"/></p>
<p>This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and introduces
neither constraints nor potential state variables. It should be
used in kinematic loops whenever possible since the non-linear
system of equations introduced by this joint aggregation is solved
<strong>analytically</strong> (i.e., a solution is always computed,
if a unique solution exists).</p>
<p>The universal joint is defined in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint
<strong>1</strong> is along parameter vector n1_a which is fixed in
frame_a.</li>
<li>The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint
<strong>2</strong> is perpendicular to axis 1 and to the line
connecting the universal and the spherical joint (= rod 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed
according to the most often occurring case. In a future release,
axis 2 might be explicitly definable via a parameter. However, the
treatment is much more complicated and the number of operations is
considerably higher, if axis 2 is not orthogonal to axis 1 and to
the connecting rod.</p>
<p>Note, there is a <strong>singularity</strong> when axis 1 and
the connecting rod are parallel to each other. Therefore, if
possible n1_a should be selected in such a way that it is
perpendicular to rRod1_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the
distance to the singularity is as large as possible).</p>
<p>The rest of this joint aggregation is defined by the following
parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The position of the spherical joint with respect to the
universal joint is defined by vector <strong>rRod1_ia</strong>.
This vector is directed from frame_a to the spherical joint and is
resolved in frame_ia (it is most simple to select frame_ia such
that it is parallel to frame_a in the reference or initial
configuration).</li>
<li>The position of the spherical joint with respect to the
revolute joint is defined by vector <strong>rRod2_ib</strong>. This
vector is directed from the inner frame of the revolute joint
(frame_ib or revolute.frame_a) to the spherical joint and is
resolved in frame_ib (note, that frame_ib and frame_b are parallel
to each other).</li>
<li>The axis of rotation of the revolute joint is defined by axis
vector <strong>n_b</strong>. It is fixed and resolved in
frame_b.</li>
<li>When specifying this joint aggregation with the definitions
above, <strong>two</strong> different
<strong>configurations</strong> are possible. Via parameter
<strong>phi_guess</strong> a guess value for revolute.phi(t0) at
the initial time t0 is given. The configuration is selected that is
closest to phi_guess (|revolute.phi - phi_guess| is minimal).</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_ia</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> in the rod connecting the universal and the
spherical joint at the origin of <strong>frame_a</strong>. The
placement of frame_ia on the rod is implicitly defined by the
universal joint (frame_a and frame_ia coincide when the angles of
the two revolute joints of the universal joint are zero) and by
parameter vector <strong>rRod1_ia</strong>, the position vector
from the origin of frame_a to the spherical joint, resolved in
frame_<strong>ia</strong>.</p>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_ib</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> in the rod connecting the revolute and the
spherical joint at the side of the revolute joint that is connected
to this rod (= rod2.frame_a = revolute.frame_a).</p>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_im</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> in the rod connecting the revolute and the
spherical joint at the side of the spherical joint that is
connected to this rod (= rod2.frame_b). It is always parallel to
<strong>frame_ib</strong>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <strong>reference
configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong> of all
components are <strong>parallel</strong> to each other
(alternatively, at least frame_a and frame_ia of the JointUSR joint
should be parallel to each other when defining an instance of this
component).</p>
<p>In the public interface of the JointUSR joint, the following
(final) <strong>parameters</strong> are provided:</p>
<pre>
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real rod1Length(unit="m")  "Length of rod 1";
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real eRod1_ia[3] "Unit vector along rod 1, resolved in frame_ia";
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real e2_ia  [3]  "Unit vector along axis 2, resolved in frame_ia";
</pre>
<p>This allows a more convenient definition of data which is
related to rod 1. For example, if a box shall be connected at
frame_ia directing from the origin of frame_a to the middle of rod
1, this might be defined as:</p>
<pre>
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointUSP jointUSR(rRod1_ia={1.2, 1, 0.2});
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Visualizers.FixedShape     shape(shapeType       = "box",
                                               lengthDirection = jointUSR.eRod1_ia,
                                               widthDirection  = jointUSR.e2_ia,
                                               length          = jointUSR.rod1Length/2,
                                               width           = jointUSR.rod1Length/10);
  <strong>equation</strong>
    <strong>connect</strong>(jointUSP.frame_ia, shape.frame_a);
