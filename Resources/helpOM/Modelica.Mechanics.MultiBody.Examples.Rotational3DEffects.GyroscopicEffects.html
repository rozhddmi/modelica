<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This example consists of a body that is attached to the world
system with a spherical joint. On this body, a "rotor", i.e., a
body with rotational symmetry is present. Two kinds of models are
shown:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the upper part of the diagram layer, only multi-body
components are used.</li>
<li>In the lower part of the diagram layer, the same model is
implemented, but by a different modeling of the cylindrical body:
The cylindrical body is included, but it is rigidly attached to its
mount. This part takes into account the movement of the center of
mass and of the inertia tensor of the cylindrical body. Note, since
the cylindrical body has rotational symmetry, its center of mass
and its inertia tensor is independent of the angle of the inertia
and can therefore be rigidly attached to its mount. Additionally,
with a "MultiBody.Parts.Rotor1D" model, a primarily 1-dim. inertia
is included that takes into account the additional effects when the
cylindrical body is moving relatively to its mounts</li>
</ul>
<p>The simulation reveals that both the kinematic movement and the
reaction forces on the environment (object "world" and "fixed"
respectively) are identical for both models.</p>
<p>A typical usage scenario is to model a complete drive train of a
vehicle, including the automatic gearbox, with elements of the
"Mechanics.Rotational" library, but using the "Rotor1D" model
instead of the "Rotational.Components.Inertia" component. This
drive train model can be mounted on a 3-dim. multi-body model of
the vehicle. Additionally, one rigid body has to be fixed to the
vehicle that has the mass, center of mass and inertia tensor of the
complete drive train. Both models together, give exactly the same
effect, as if every part of the drive train would have been
modelled solely with mult-body components. One benefit of this
modeling is that the simulation is much faster.</p>
