<p>This blocks models various types of filters:</p>
<blockquote><strong>low pass, high pass, band pass, and band stop
filters</strong></blockquote>
<p>using various filter characteristics:</p>
<blockquote><strong>CriticalDamping, Bessel, Butterworth, Chebyshev
Type I filters</strong></blockquote>
<p>By default, a filter block is initialized in
<strong>steady-state</strong>, in order to avoid unwanted
oscillations at the beginning. In special cases, it might be useful
to select one of the other initialization options under tab
"Advanced".</p>
<p>Typical frequency responses for the 4 supported low pass filter
types are shown in the next figure:</p>
<blockquote><img alt="LowPassOrder4Filters.png" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Blocks/LowPassOrder4Filters.png"/></blockquote>
<p>The step responses of the same low pass filters are shown in the
next figure, starting from a steady state initial filter with
initial input = 0.2:</p>
<blockquote><img alt="LowPassOrder4FiltersStepResponse.png" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Blocks/LowPassOrder4FiltersStepResponse.png"/></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the frequency responses give a somewhat wrong
impression of the filter characteristics: Although Butterworth and
Chebyshev filters have a significantly steeper magnitude as the
CriticalDamping and Bessel filters, the step responses of the
latter ones are much better. This means for example, that a
CriticalDamping or a Bessel filter should be selected, if a filter
is mainly used to make a non-linear inverse model realizable.</p>
<p>Typical frequency responses for the 4 supported high pass filter
types are shown in the next figure:</p>
<blockquote><img alt="HighPassOrder4Filters.png" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Blocks/HighPassOrder4Filters.png"/></blockquote>
<p>The corresponding step responses of these high pass filters are
shown in the next figure:</p>
<blockquote><img alt="HighPassOrder4FiltersStepResponse.png" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Blocks/HighPassOrder4FiltersStepResponse.png"/></blockquote>
<p>All filters are available in <strong>normalized</strong>
(default) and non-normalized form. In the normalized form, the
amplitude of the filter transfer function at the cut-off frequency
f_cut is -3 dB (= 10^(-3/20) = 0.70794..). Note, when comparing the
filters of this function with other software systems, the setting
of "normalized" has to be selected appropriately. For example, the
signal processing toolbox of MATLAB provides the filters in
non-normalized form and therefore a comparison makes only sense, if
normalized = <strong>false</strong> is set. A normalized filter is
usually better suited for applications, since filters of different
orders are "comparable", whereas non-normalized filters usually
require to adapt the cut-off frequency, when the order of the
filter is changed. See a comparison of "normalized" and
"non-normalized" filters at hand of CriticalDamping filters of
order 1,2,3:</p>
<blockquote><img alt="CriticalDampingNormalized.png" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Blocks/CriticalDampingNormalized.png"/></blockquote>
<blockquote><img alt="CriticalDampingNonNormalized.png" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Blocks/CriticalDampingNonNormalized.png"/></blockquote>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>The filters are implemented in the following, reliable way:</p>
<ol>
<li>A prototype low pass filter with a cut-off angular frequency of
1 rad/s is constructed from the desired analogFilter and the
desired normalization.</li>
<li>This prototype low pass filter is transformed to the desired
filterType and the desired cut-off frequency f_cut using a
transformation on the Laplace variable "s".</li>
<li>The resulting first and second order transfer functions are
implemented in state space form, using the "eigen value"
representation of a transfer function:
<pre>

  // second order block with eigen values: a +/- jb
  <strong>der</strong>(x1) = a*x1 - b*x2 + (a^2 + b^2)/b*u;
  <strong>der</strong>(x2) = b*x1 + a*x2;
       y  = x2;
     </pre>
The dc-gain from the input to the output of this block is one and
the selected states are in the order of the input (if "u" is in the
order of "one", then the states are also in the order of "one"). In
the "Advanced" tab, a "nominal" value for the input "u" can be
given. If appropriately selected, the states are in the order of
"one" and then step-size control is always appropriate.</li>
