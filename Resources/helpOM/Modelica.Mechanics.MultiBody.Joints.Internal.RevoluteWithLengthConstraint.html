<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Joint where frame_b rotates around axis n which is fixed in
frame_a. The two frames coincide when "phi + phi_offset = 0", where
"phi_offset" is a parameter with a zero default and "phi" is the
rotation angle.</p>
<p>This variant of the revolute joint is designed to work together
with a length constraint in a kinematic loop. This means that the
angle of the revolute joint, phi, is computed such that the length
constraint is fulfilled.</p>
<p><strong>Usually, this joint should not be used by a user of the
MultiBody library. It is only provided to built-up the
Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointXYZ
joints.</strong></p>
<p>In releases before version 3.0 of the Modelica Standard Library,
it was possible to activate the torque projection equation (=
cut-torque projected to the rotation axis must be identical to the
drive torque of flange axis) via parameter
<strong>axisTorqueBalance</strong>. This is no longer possible,
since otherwise this model would not be "balanced" (= same number
of unknowns as equations). Instead, when using this model in
version 3.0 and later versions, the force in the length constraint
component (Joints.SphericalSpherical or Joints.UniversalSpherical)
must be calculated such that the driving torque in direction of the
rotation axis is (RC shall be the name of the instance of
RevoluteWithLengthConstraint):</p>
<pre>
    0 = RC.axis.tau + RC.e*RC.frame_b.t;
</pre>
<p>If this equation is used, usually the force in the length
constraint and the second derivative of the revolute angle will be
part of a linear algebraic system of equations. In some cases it is
possible to solve this system of equations locally, i.e., provide
the rod force directly as function of the revolute constraint
torque. In any case, this projection equation or an equivalent one
has to be provided via variable "constraintResidue" in the
"Advanced" menu of "Joints.SphericalSpherical" or
"Joints.UniversalSpherical".</p>
