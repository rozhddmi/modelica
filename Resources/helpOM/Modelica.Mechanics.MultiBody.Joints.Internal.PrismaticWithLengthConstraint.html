<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Joint where frame_b is translated along axis n which is fixed in
frame_a. The two frames coincide when "s + s_offset = 0", where
"s_offset" is a parameter with a zero default and "s" is the
relative distance.</p>
<p>This variant of the prismatic joint is designed to work together
with a length constraint in a kinematic loop. This means that the
relative distance "s" of the joint is computed such that the length
constraint is fulfilled.</p>
<p><strong>Usually, this joint should not be used by a user of the
MultiBody library. It is only provided to built-up the
Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointXYZ
joints.</strong></p>
<p>In releases before version 3.0 of the Modelica Standard Library,
it was possible to activate the force projection equation (=
cut-force projected to the translation axis must be identical to
the driving force of flange axis) via parameter
<strong>axisForceBalance</strong>. This is no longer possible,
since otherwise this model would not be "balanced" (= same number
of unknowns as equations). Instead, when using this model in
version 3.0 and later versions, the force in the length constraint
component (Joints.SphericalSpherical or Joints.UniversalSpherical)
must be calculated such that the driving force in direction of the
translation axis is (RC shall be the name of the instance of
PrismaticWithLengthConstraint):</p>
<pre>
    0 = RC.axis.f + RC.e*RC.frame_b.f;
</pre>
<p>If this equation is used, usually the force in the length
constraint and the second derivative of the prismatic distance will
be part of a linear algebraic system of equations. In some cases it
is possible to solve this system of equations locally, i.e.,
provide the rod force directly as function of the prismatic
constraint force. In any case, this projection equation or an
equivalent one has to be provided via variable "constraintResidue"
in the "Advanced" menu of "Joints.SphericalSpherical" or
"Joints.UniversalSpherical".</p>
