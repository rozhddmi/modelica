<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Model of a tank that is open to the ambient at the fixed
pressure <code>p_ambient</code>.</p>
<p>The vector of connectors <strong>ports</strong> represents fluid
ports at configurable heights, relative to the bottom of tank.
Fluid can flow either out of or in to each port.</p>
The following assumptions are made:
<ul>
<li>The tank is filled with a single or multiple-substance medium
having a density higher than the density of the ambient
medium.</li>
<li>The fluid has uniform density, temperature and mass
fractions</li>
<li>No liquid is leaving the tank through the open top; the
simulation breaks with an assertion if the liquid level growths
over the height.</li>
</ul>
<p>The port pressures represent the pressures just after the outlet
(or just before the inlet) in the attached pipe. The hydraulic
resistances <code>portsData.zeta_in</code> and
<code>portsData.zeta_out</code> determine the dissipative pressure
drop between tank and port depending on the direction of mass flow.
See <a href="Modelica.Fluid.Vessels.BaseClasses.VesselPortsData.html">VesselPortsData</a>
and <em>[Idelchik, Handbook of Hydraulic Resistance,
2004]</em>.</p>
<p>With the setting <code>use_portsData=false</code>, the port
pressure represents the static head at the height of the respective
port. The relationship between pressure drop and mass flow rate at
the port must then be provided by connected components; Heights of
ports as well as kinetic and potential energy of fluid entering or
leaving are not taken into account anymore.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Dec. 12, 2008</em> by Rüdiger Franke: move port definitions
to BaseClasses.PartialLumpedVessel; also use energy and mass
balance from common base class</li>
<li><em>Dec. 8, 2008</em> by Michael Wetter (LBNL):<br/>
Implemented trace substances.</li>
<li><em>Jan. 6, 2006</em> by Katja Poschlad, Manuel Remelhe (AST
Uni Dortmund), Martin Otter (DLR):<br/>
Implementation based on former tank model.</li>
<li><em>Oct. 29, 2007</em> by Carsten Heinrich (ILK Dresden):<br/>
Adapted to the new fluid library interfaces:
<ul>
<li>FluidPorts_b is used instead of FluidPort_b (due to it is
defined as an array of ports)</li>
<li>Port name changed from port to ports</li>
</ul>
Updated documentation.</li>
<li><em>Apr. 25, 2006</em> by Katrin Prölß (TUHH):<br/>
Limitation to bottom ports only, added inlet and outlet loss
factors.</li>
</ul>
